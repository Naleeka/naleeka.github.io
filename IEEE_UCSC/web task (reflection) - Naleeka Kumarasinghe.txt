I wanted the website to feel like something premium but I clearly had no idea what it should look like.
So I first tried to add white-blue-red mesh color background on navigation bar.
Then i added muted ,looped video on home page.
I had only few topics on my mind and build sections according to those topics.
I filled those sections contents with our IEEE main page content.
Added some animations, hover effects, click effects & icons to make the site little alive.

-What I learned ðŸŽ“
I learned how to use @font-face to import custom fonts

-What i was stucked with ðŸ¥´
I couldn't compress the video anymore.It's quality get really bad when i tried to compress it using ["https://www.veed.io/tools/video-compressor"] 
I couldn't make the web site responsive.

-Issues I faced ðŸ¤”
I couldn't make titles animations trigger when we scroll to the specific page. So I searched on youtube and found a solution to it ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T33NN_pPeNI&t=212s"]
