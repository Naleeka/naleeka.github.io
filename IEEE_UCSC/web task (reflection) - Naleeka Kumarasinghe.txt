I wanted the website to feel like something premium but I clearly had no idea what it should look like.
So I first tried to add white-blue-red mesh colour background on navigation bar.
Then i added muted ,looped video on home page.
I had only few topics on my mind and build sections according to those topics.
I filled those sections contents with our IEEE main page content.
Added some animations to make the site little alive.

-What I learned
I learned how to use @font-face to import custom fonts

-What i was stucked with
I couldn't compress the video anymore.It's quality get really bad when i tried to compress it using [https://www.veed.io/tools/video-compressor]
