## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I found out how to build a drop down menu

### Continued development

I want to understand "How can I be sure I made the website perfectly responsive ?"

If I go through with all the device resolutions given by the firefox "responsive mode" , is that mean I've done my job perfectly ?

Or is it not ??
